Developing the physical model of the Hematopoietic Cell Transplant domain in BRIDG

From the BRIDG 3.2 release notes:
Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) Database â€“ This project is designed to produce a BRIDG-compatible model and database (with associated Common Data Elements (CDEs)) covering the scope of federally-mandated data submission from all transplant centers to the Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes Database (SCTOD).  In association with integration engines to be developed in tandem but outside the scope of this project, the application will support direct connection between center databases of varying types and the SCTOD.  The feasibility of this design has already been demonstrated at MD Anderson using a non-BRIDG compatible data model but caDSR-curated CDEs.  Successful implementation will demonstrate high-volume clinical data transmission using the GRID for sharing of center-generated standardized clinical outcome data.  It will also support intra-center data exchange and transmission of data to the CTRP and the .gov databases without data transcription.  The harmonization of the HCT concepts has occurred in phases, the first of which was included in release 3.1 and covered concepts related to donor and recipient information.  The second phase harmonized HCT concepts that are related to product processing and storage.  Because HCT is an emerging field, we anticipate further changes to BRIDG to harmonize that content in later releases.
